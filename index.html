            <blockquote>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Nisha Priyadharshini J — but you can just call me Nisha. Born and raised in India, I’m currently 20 years old, soon to embrace 21 this July 17. It’s funny how adulthood sneaks up on you, and I’m just beginning to feel the weight of it settling in. I’m an engineering student by day, but a reader at heart. There isn’t much to say about me in loud, flashy terms — I’m an introvert, more comfortable in the quiet company of books than in crowded rooms. You’ll usually find me curled up in bed, lost in stories that have been my refuge and my world since I was a child. Books have always been my escape, my solace, and my greatest adventure. Alongside my love for reading, I’ve developed a passion for creating — specifically, web development. As I learn and grow in this field, I wanted to combine my two favorite worlds: books and websites. That’s how this blog was born — a simple space where I can share my thoughts, reviews, and love for books. While social platforms like Instagram connect many readers, I’ve noticed a lack of a dedicated, intimate community where readers can truly come together and share their stories. If I ever become the web developer I dream of, I’d love to create that very space — a place where readers can feel seen, heard, and connected.For now, this little corner of the web is my starting point, my way of blending passion with purpose. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that speaks to your own love for stories.</p>

            <h3>Empryean Series by Rebecca Yarros</h3>
            <p>I would rate this book 100/10. I picked up the book because I kept seeing reels about this book and I was intrigued, mainly becaus of tairn. I picked this book for Violet and Tairn bond because I saw soo many reels about it and I wanted to see if it was worth the hype. I'm happy to say that I'm not disappointed. Though I must admit it took me through an emotional roller coaster ride. Xaden's and Violet's chemistry was just top notch. The slow burn, the tension⏤it was breathtaking. And god, I love Tairn sooo much. He have all my respect. It has five books and only three have been released. Yes, waiting for book four is such a torture. If you are looking for a slow burn romance + enemies to lovers + dragons + romantasy + morally grey male lead, then this book is for you.</p> </blockquote>

            <h3>A Court Of Thorn And Roses by Sarah J. Maas</h3>
            <p>At first I was skeptic about reading this book. I'm a picky reader and many of my friend kept saying it was boring and all that so I kept skipping. But then later I understood just how you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't judge a book by anyone else opinions. If you like it, you like it, that's it. One day, I had no books to read but I really wanted to read one, so I just said let's just try this and god, I regretted not reading it sooner. I loved the plot and literally all the character development of every characters in the book. I loved every character in the book had their own story, rather than being overlooked as side characters. Literally well written. The way Rhysand supported Feyre even when she hated him, that's something I would want in my boyfriend (minus me hating him part but you get me). However I might warn you, the first book was little boring, but after the second book, it gets good. I would really rate it 8/10. If you loved Beauty and Beast, you'll definitely love this one </p> </blockquote>

            <h3>Shatter Me Series by Taherah Mafi</h3>
            <p>Ah, my all time favorite book. I was interested because of it's different writing style and also because of Aaron Warner. My insta feed was all about him and I was quite into it so I picked up the book and I couldn't keep it down even for a second. Hell, I ruined my whole sleeping schedule to binge reading all the books in the series. I have read so many book after this series, however, no one could literally top Aaron Warner. He would always be my top 1 fictional boyfriend. The way Juliette transferred from a girl who hated herself and her powers to the girl who learned to love herself and embrace her powers and grew powerful, breaking all the obstacle in her way. It felt a bit personal to me hahah. The way Aaron encouraged her to embrace it rather than being scared for her and that he helped her grow both personally and physically was really so... heart touching. (Ah, man why doesn't guys like Aaron Warner doesn't exist?). Plus, Juliette and Kenji friendship was literally soo wholesome throughout the book. I would totally rate this book 1000/10. If you love reading about found family, Morally grey mc, enemies to lovers, dystopian tropes, then this book is definitely for you.</p>

            <p>Tristan Caine>>>>>>> hahaha, I love Tristan Caine so much. If anyone ever noticed me, made me feel loved by simple and silent gestures like Tristan, I'd really melt. But unfortunate fact is that guys like Tristan Caine doesn't exist in real life. I loved all the other pair too, but Tristan and Morana will always be my top couple in that series. However, I was quite upset with the last book, The Syndicator. The Tristan Caine, who notices everything about Morana, couldn't notice her pain. Morana went through so much, did so much to help Tristan find his sister, however it felt like she was forgotton in that book and less appreciated. The author did Morana bad in book 6. But, I understand we can't complain because it's her book, she decides how the story goes or ends. This is just my personal opinion, no hate. But apparent from all that, this whole series was a good read. I would totally recommend it.</p>

            <p>Here’s where my heart spills onto the page—an ode to the stories that shape me and the characters who feel like old friends. These are the tropes and themes that tug at my soul and remind me why I fell in love with reading in the first place.</p>
            <br>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>📖 Enemies to Lovers</strong></dt>
                <dd>I can’t resist the tension that blooms between two people who swear they hate each other—until their stolen glances say otherwise. There’s something beautiful about watching walls crumble and hearts surrender.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>📖 Found Family</strong></dt>
                <dd>There’s nothing quite like a group of misfits finding a place they belong, patching each other’s wounds with laughter and tears. These stories remind me that sometimes, the family we choose is the one that saves us.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>📖 Second Chances</strong></dt>
                <dd>Stories where love returns, weathered by time and mistakes but stronger than before. They remind me that healing is possible and that love can find its way back even when it’s lost.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>📖 Forbidden Love</strong></dt>
                <dd>A love that shouldn’t exist, yet defies every rule written in ink and blood. It’s the thrill of stolen moments and the ache of impossible choices—sometimes the most powerful love is the one that’s forbidden.</dd>
                <br>
                 <dt><strong>📖 Grumpy x Sunshine</strong></dt>
                <dd>Nothing makes me smile like watching a guarded heart slowly melt under the warmth of someone’s light. It’s the quiet unraveling of old hurts and the softest kind of healing.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>📖 Hidden Identities</strong></dt>
                <dd>When secrets are more than just secrets, and every lie feels like a test of trust. I love the slow reveal, the moment a character strips away the mask and shows who they really are.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>📖 Soulmates</strong></dt>
                <dd>A love that feels written in the stars—like fate itself guided two souls to each other. It’s the kind of love that makes me believe in forever, even in the darkest stories.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>📖 Royal Intrigue</strong></dt>
                <dd>Crowns and castles, secrets and power—where love is entangled in politics and every kiss feels like rebellion. These stories are rich tapestries of betrayal and loyalty, and I never tire of them.</dd>
                <br>
                 <dt><strong>📖 Redemption</strong></dt>
                <dd>Watching a character rise from their own ashes, learning that they can be more than their past mistakes. It’s the hope that we all deserve a second chance, no matter how broken we think we are.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>📖 Slow Burn</strong></dt>
                <dd>The kind of love that simmers and grows, where every brush of a hand and every stolen look feels electric. It’s a dance of longing that leaves me breathless every time.</dd>
                <br>
            </dl>
            <p>These are the stories I reach for when I need to feel something real—when I want to believe in messy, imperfect love that survives even the harshest nights. They’re the threads that weave my favorite tales, and I hope they find a place in your heart too.</p>
